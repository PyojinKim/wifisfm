# 1. Usage
* Download the dataset from https://www.dropbox.com/s/qfnu7s655r72emy/data.zip?dl=0, and extract the zip file.

* Run WiFi_SfM_core/main_script_TangoVIO.m which will give you the "roughly" aligned VIO trajectories against Google FLP. Enjoy! :)


# 2. Publications
The WiFi SfM approach is based on the following publications:

* **RoNIN: Robust Neural Inertial Navigation in the Wild: Benchmark, Evaluations, and New Methods** (Sachini Herath, Hang Yan, and Yasutaka Furukawa), ICRA 2020.
